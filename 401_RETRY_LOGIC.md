# 401 UNAUTHORIZED Retry Logic - Implementation

## Problem

When the E-Modal session creation fails with **401 UNAUTHORIZED** error:
- Usually caused by temporary issues with 2captcha service or E-Modal platform
- System would immediately fail the query
- User had to manually retry the entire query
- No automatic recovery mechanism

**Error Flow Before:**
```
Container request ‚Üí 400 BAD REQUEST (expired session)
  ‚Üì
Try to recover session ‚Üí 401 UNAUTHORIZED
  ‚Üì
Query fails immediately ‚ùå
```

## Solution

Added **automatic retry logic with 10-minute delays** for 401 UNAUTHORIZED errors:
- System detects 401 errors during session creation
- Waits 10 minutes before retrying
- Attempts up to 3 times (configurable)
- Provides clear console feedback during wait

**Error Flow After:**
```
Container request ‚Üí 400 BAD REQUEST (expired session)
  ‚Üì
Try to recover session ‚Üí 401 UNAUTHORIZED
  ‚Üì
Wait 10 minutes... (with countdown)
  ‚Üì
Retry session creation ‚Üí Success! ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Query continues normally
```

## Changes Made

### File: `services/query_service.py`

#### 1. Updated `_ensure_session()` Method

**New Parameters:**
- `max_retries=3`: Maximum retry attempts for 401 errors
- `retry_delay_minutes=10`: Minutes to wait between retries

**Behavior:**
- Detects 401 UNAUTHORIZED errors
- Waits 10 minutes before each retry
- Shows countdown in console
- Retries up to 3 times
- Fails only after all retries exhausted

#### 2. Updated `_recover_session()` Method

Same retry logic as `_ensure_session()`:
- 3 retry attempts with 10-minute delays
- Clear console feedback
- Countdown timer
- Automatic retry on 401 errors

---

## Console Output

### During Wait Period:
```
[WARNING] 401 UNAUTHORIZED - Session creation failed
[INFO] This is likely a temporary issue with 2captcha or E-Modal
[INFO] Waiting 10 minutes before retry 2/3...
[INFO] Waiting... 10 minutes remaining
[INFO] Waiting... 9 minutes remaining
[INFO] Waiting... 8 minutes remaining
...
[INFO] Waiting... 1 minutes remaining
[INFO] Retrying session creation now...
```

### After Successful Retry:
```
[INFO] Creating new E-Modal session for user jfernandez (attempt 2/3)
[INFO] Session created successfully: session_1759808540_-44251561...
```

### After All Retries Failed:
```
[ERROR] All 3 session creation attempts failed with 401 UNAUTHORIZED
Query failed: Failed to create E-Modal session after 3 attempts: 401 Client Error: UNAUTHORIZED
```

---

## Retry Logic Flow

```
Attempt 1: Try to create session
    ‚Üì
  401 UNAUTHORIZED
    ‚Üì
Wait 10 minutes
    ‚Üì
Attempt 2: Try to create session
    ‚Üì
  401 UNAUTHORIZED
    ‚Üì
Wait 10 minutes
    ‚Üì
Attempt 3: Try to create session
    ‚Üì
  Success! ‚úÖ or Final failure ‚ùå
```

---

## Why 10 Minutes?

1. **2captcha service** may have temporary rate limits or queue delays
2. **E-Modal platform** may have temporary login restrictions
3. **Captcha generation** may take time to refresh
4. **Network issues** usually resolve within minutes
5. **Balance** between quick retry and avoiding rate limits

---

## Configuration

### Default Settings:
```python
max_retries = 3                # 3 attempts total
retry_delay_minutes = 10       # 10 minutes between retries
```

### To Customize:
Modify the method signatures in `services/query_service.py`:

```python
def _ensure_session(self, user, max_retries=5, retry_delay_minutes=15):
    # Will retry 5 times with 15-minute delays
```

---

## Error Types Handled

### Will Retry (401 errors):
- `401 Client Error: UNAUTHORIZED`
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED` in error message
- Authentication failures
- Captcha service issues

### Will NOT Retry (other errors):
- `400 BAD REQUEST` (different issue)
- `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`
- `403 FORBIDDEN`
- Network connection errors
- Invalid credentials (permanent issue)

---

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Temporary 401 Error
```
1. Trigger query
2. System gets 401 on first attempt
3. Waits 10 minutes
4. Retries successfully
5. Query continues ‚úÖ
```

### Test Scenario 2: Persistent 401 Error
```
1. Trigger query
2. System gets 401 on attempt 1
3. Waits 10 minutes
4. Gets 401 on attempt 2
5. Waits 10 minutes
6. Gets 401 on attempt 3
7. Query fails after 30 minutes total ‚ùå
```

### Test Scenario 3: Immediate Success
```
1. Trigger query
2. Session created on first attempt
3. No waiting, query continues immediately ‚úÖ
```

---

## Impact on Query Duration

### Best Case (No 401 errors):
- No additional time
- Query completes normally (30-40 minutes)

### With 1 Retry:
- +10 minutes wait time
- Query completes in ~40-50 minutes

### With 2 Retries:
- +20 minutes wait time
- Query completes in ~50-60 minutes

### With 3 Retries (all fail):
- +20 minutes wait time
- Query fails after ~30 minutes of retries

---

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Before (No Retry):
- ‚ùå Query fails immediately on 401
- ‚ùå User must manually retry
- ‚ùå Wastes processed data
- ‚ùå Poor user experience

### ‚úÖ After (With Retry):
- ‚úÖ Automatic recovery from temporary issues
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed
- ‚úÖ Preserves all processed data
- ‚úÖ Much better user experience
- ‚úÖ Clear feedback during wait
- ‚úÖ Query continues seamlessly after recovery

---

## When to Use Manual Retry

Even with automatic retry, you may need manual intervention if:

1. **Invalid Credentials**: E-Modal username/password are wrong
2. **Invalid API Key**: 2captcha API key is incorrect
3. **Account Issues**: E-Modal account is locked/suspended
4. **Service Outage**: E-Modal platform is completely down

In these cases, the system will fail after 3 attempts (~30 minutes), and you'll need to:
- Check credentials in `user_cre_env.json`
- Verify 2captcha account has credits
- Check E-Modal account status
- Wait for service to come back online

---

## Monitoring

### Check Query Status:
```
GET /queries/{query_id}
```

### Query Status Values:
- `pending` - Query not started yet
- `in_progress` - Query running (may be in retry wait)
- `completed` - Query finished successfully
- `failed` - Query failed after all retries

### Check Error Message:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "status": "failed",
    "error_message": "Failed to create E-Modal session after 3 attempts: 401 UNAUTHORIZED"
  }
}
```

---

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety:
- Each retry sleeps for 60 seconds at a time (not blocking entire thread)
- Console updates every minute with countdown
- Database commits after successful session creation

### Memory:
- No additional memory overhead
- Session response stored only on success
- Failed attempts don't accumulate data

### Logging:
- All attempts logged with timestamps
- Wait periods logged
- Success/failure logged
- Full error messages preserved

---

## Summary

‚úÖ System now automatically retries 401 UNAUTHORIZED errors  
‚úÖ 3 attempts with 10-minute delays  
‚úÖ Clear console feedback with countdown  
‚úÖ Applies to both initial session creation and session recovery  
‚úÖ Non-401 errors still fail immediately (no waiting)  
‚úÖ Configurable retry count and delay  

**Result**: Much more robust query execution with automatic recovery from temporary 2captcha/E-Modal issues! üéâ
