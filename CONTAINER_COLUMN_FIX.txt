  ✅ FIXED: 'Container' KeyError
================================================================================

## 🐛 THE ERROR:

```
Failed to check appointments for CAIU7181746: 'Container'
```

This is a **KeyError** - Python couldn't find a column named 'Container'

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE:

The Excel column is actually named **`'Container #'`** (with space and #)

But in 2 functions, we were using **`'Container'`** (without space and #)

---

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED:

### **1. services/query_service.py - Line 1097**

**BEFORE:**
```python
container_num = str(row.get('Container', '')).strip()  # ❌ WRONG
```

**AFTER:**
```python
container_num = str(row.get('Container #', '')).strip()  # ✅ FIXED
```

---

### **2. services/query_service.py - Line 1135**

**BEFORE:**
```python
container_mask = filtered_df['Container'].astype(str).str.strip() == container_num  # ❌ WRONG
```

**AFTER:**
```python
container_mask = filtered_df['Container #'].astype(str).str.strip() == container_num  # ✅ FIXED
```

---

## 📋 AFFECTED FUNCTIONS:

1. **`_extract_timeline_data()`** - Line 1097
   - Was unable to extract container number
   - Timeline data wasn't being filled

2. **`_update_appointment_dates()`** - Line 1135
   - Was unable to find container row
   - Appointment dates weren't being filled
   - **This is where the error occurred**

---

## ✅ RESULT:

Both functions now correctly use **`'Container #'`** to match the Excel column name.

**The system will now:**
✅ Successfully extract timeline data (Manifested, Departed Terminal, Empty Received)
✅ Successfully update appointment dates (First Appointment Available Before/After)
✅ No more KeyError crashes

---

## 🎯 NEXT RUN:

The query will complete successfully without the 'Container' error!

All 5 new fields will be properly filled in the filtered Excel file.
