# üîç DEBUGGING BULK API HANG

## Current Status:
The system is stuck at the bulk API call. The request was sent to:
`http://37.60.243.201:5010/get_info_bulk`

**Containers:**
- IMPORT: 10 containers
- EXPORT: 3 containers

## What I Added:

### 1. **Detailed Response Timing** ‚úÖ
- Shows exactly when request is sent
- Measures response time in seconds
- Shows when response is received

### 2. **Response Content Details** ‚úÖ
- Content length (bytes)
- Content type (JSON vs other)
- Status code
- Response headers

### 3. **JSON Parsing Debug** ‚úÖ
- Shows when JSON parsing starts
- Shows when JSON parsing completes
- Shows response data keys
- Shows success/failure status

### 4. **Exception Handling** ‚úÖ
- Prints exception type
- Prints full error message
- Prints full stack trace
- Shows exactly where it fails

## Possible Issues:

### 1. **Timeout (Most Likely)**
The remote server might be taking longer than expected to process 13 containers.

**Fix:** Already set to 40 minutes (2400s) ‚úÖ

### 2. **Large Response**
The response might be very large and taking time to transfer.

**Debug:** Will now show content length and transfer time

### 3. **JSON Parsing**
The response might be valid but taking time to parse.

**Debug:** Will now show before/after JSON parsing

### 4. **Network Issues**
Connection might be slow or dropping.

**Debug:** Will now show timing and exception details

## How to Test:

1. **Stop current server** (CTRL+C)
2. **Restart server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. **Trigger new query:**
   ```bash
   python trigger_first_query.py
   ```
4. **Watch detailed output** - you'll now see:
   - "REQUEST SENT - Waiting for E-Modal API to respond..."
   - "Response received after X seconds!"
   - "Content length: X bytes"
   - "Attempting to parse JSON response..."
   - "JSON parsed successfully!"
   - "Response data keys: [...]"

## What You Should See:

If working correctly:
```
>>> REQUEST SENT - Waiting for E-Modal API to respond...
>>> Response received after 45.3 seconds!
>>> Status code: 200
>>> Content length: 15234 bytes
>>> Content type: application/json
>>> Attempting to parse JSON response...
>>> Calling response.json()...
>>> JSON parsed successfully!
>>> Response data keys: ['success', 'results', 'session_id']
>>> Bulk summary: {'import_processed': 10, 'export_processed': 3}
```

If hanging:
```
>>> REQUEST SENT - Waiting for E-Modal API to respond...
[HANGS HERE - No response from E-Modal API]
```

If error:
```
>>> Response received after 2.1 seconds!
>>> Status code: 500
>>> [EXCEPTION] Bulk request failed: HTTPError: 500 Server Error
```

## Next Steps:

1. Restart server with new debug logging
2. Trigger query
3. Report exactly where it hangs or what error appears

This will tell us EXACTLY where the problem is! üîç
