  ✅ NEW FIELDS IMPLEMENTATION - CONFIRMED & ENHANCED
================================================================================

## ✅ YES, WE HAVE THIS LOGIC!

The 5 new fields ARE implemented and are added/filled correctly:

### **New Fields:**
1. Manifested
2. First Appointment Available (Before)
3. Departed Terminal
4. First Appointment Available (After)
5. Empty Received

---

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION FLOW:

### **STEP 1: After Filtering - Add Columns Immediately**
**Location:** `services/query_service.py` Lines 520-532

```python
# Add new columns (S onwards) for appointment data
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Adding appointment tracking columns...")
filtered_df['Manifested'] = 'N/A'
filtered_df['First Appointment Available (Before)'] = 'N/A'
filtered_df['Departed Terminal'] = 'N/A'
filtered_df['First Appointment Available (After)'] = 'N/A'
filtered_df['Empty Received'] = 'N/A'
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Added columns: {list(filtered_df.columns)[-5:]}")

# Save filtered file with new columns
filtered_df.to_excel(filtered_file, index=False)
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Filtered file saved: {filtered_file}")
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Total columns in Excel: {len(filtered_df.columns)}")
```

✅ **Result:** Filtered Excel file has 5 new columns, all initialized to "N/A"

---

### **STEP 2: After Bulk API - Fill Timeline Data**
**Location:** `services/query_service.py` Lines 552-558

```python
# Extract timeline milestones from bulk_info and update filtered_df
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Extracting timeline milestones...")
self._extract_timeline_data(filtered_df, bulk_info)

# Save updated filtered file with timeline data
filtered_df.to_excel(filtered_file, index=False)
print(f"[QUERY {query.query_id}] Timeline data added to filtered file")
```

**What `_extract_timeline_data()` does:** (Lines 1093-1121)
- Loops through each IMPORT container
- Extracts from bulk_info timeline:
  - **Manifested** date
  - **Departed Terminal** date
  - **Empty Received** date
- Updates filtered_df with these dates
- EXPORT containers keep "N/A" for these fields

✅ **Result:** Filtered Excel file now has timeline dates for IMPORT containers

---

### **STEP 3: During Appointment Checks - Fill Appointment Dates**
**Location:** `services/query_service.py` Lines 981-986

```python
# Extract and update appointment dates in filtered_df
self._update_appointment_dates(
    filtered_df, 
    container_num, 
    appointment_response.get('available_times', []),
    move_type
)
```

**What `_update_appointment_dates()` does:** (Lines 1123-1143)
- Finds the earliest appointment date from available_times
- Updates filtered_df based on move_type:
  - **PICK FULL** → Updates "First Appointment Available (Before)"
  - **DROP EMPTY** → Updates "First Appointment Available (After)"

✅ **Result:** Appointment dates filled as each container is processed

---

### **STEP 4: Save Progress During Processing**
**Location:** `services/query_service.py` Lines 1008-1014

```python
# Save progress to filtered Excel file every 5 containers
if len(processed_containers) % 5 == 0:
    try:
        filtered_df.to_excel(filtered_file, index=False)
        print(f"  > Progress saved: {len(processed_containers)}/{len(filtered_df)} containers")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to save progress to Excel: {e}")
```

✅ **Result:** Excel file updates every 5 containers (prevents data loss)

---

### **STEP 5: Final Save**
**Location:** `services/query_service.py` Lines 1016-1021

```python
# Final save to filtered Excel file
try:
    filtered_df.to_excel(filtered_file, index=False)
    print(f"[SUCCESS] Final data saved to filtered Excel file")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to save final data to Excel: {e}")
```

✅ **Result:** Complete filtered Excel file with all data

---

## 📊 FIELD POPULATION SUMMARY:

| Field | Filled For | Filled When | Source |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Manifested** | IMPORT only | After bulk API | Timeline milestone |
| **First Appointment Available (Before)** | IMPORT with PICK FULL | During appointment checks | Available times |
| **Departed Terminal** | IMPORT only | After bulk API | Timeline milestone |
| **First Appointment Available (After)** | IMPORT with DROP EMPTY | During appointment checks | Available times |
| **Empty Received** | IMPORT only | After bulk API | Timeline milestone |

**EXPORT containers:** All fields remain "N/A" (as timeline data doesn't apply)

---

## 🐛 DEBUGGING ENHANCEMENTS ADDED:

To help you see what's happening:

1. **Line 527:** Shows the 5 new column names after adding them
2. **Line 532:** Shows total number of columns in Excel
3. **Line 558:** Confirms timeline data was added to filtered file
4. **Lines 1120-1121:** Shows how many IMPORT containers were updated with timeline data

These will print to your terminal during query execution.

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

To verify the fields exist in your Excel file:

1. ✅ **After query completes**, open: `storage/users/1/emodal/queries/q_XXX/filtered_containers.xlsx`
2. ✅ **Scroll right** to the last 5 columns (after column R "Tags")
3. ✅ **Expected columns (S-W):**
   - S: Manifested
   - T: First Appointment Available (Before)
   - U: Departed Terminal
   - V: First Appointment Available (After)
   - W: Empty Received

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

### **For IMPORT Container (PICK FULL):**
- Manifested: Date (e.g., "01/15/2025")
- First Appointment Available (Before): Date (e.g., "01/20/2025")
- Departed Terminal: Date or "N/A"
- First Appointment Available (After): "N/A"
- Empty Received: "N/A"

### **For IMPORT Container (DROP EMPTY):**
- Manifested: Date (e.g., "01/15/2025")
- First Appointment Available (Before): "N/A"
- Departed Terminal: Date (e.g., "01/18/2025")
- First Appointment Available (After): Date (e.g., "01/22/2025")
- Empty Received: Date or "N/A"

### **For EXPORT Container:**
- All fields: "N/A"

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:

**If you still don't see the fields:**

1. **Check the correct file:**
   - File: `storage/users/1/emodal/queries/q_[QUERY_ID]/filtered_containers.xlsx`
   - NOT: `storage/users/1/emodal/all_containers.xlsx`

2. **Check the terminal output:**
   - Should see: `[QUERY q_XXX] Added columns: [...]`
   - Should see: `[QUERY q_XXX] Total columns in Excel: XX`
   - Should see: `> Updated timeline data for X IMPORT containers`

3. **Verify Excel file was saved:**
   - Check file modification timestamp
   - Should update every 5 containers + final save

4. **Check pandas/openpyxl versions:**
   - Make sure they're not corrupting the Excel file

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION:

**THE LOGIC IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED!**

✅ Fields are added immediately after filtering
✅ Timeline data is filled from bulk API
✅ Appointment dates are filled during checks
✅ File is saved multiple times (every 5 containers + final)
✅ Enhanced debugging added to show what's happening

**Next run will show detailed output about column creation and updates.**
